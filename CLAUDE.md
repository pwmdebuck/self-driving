# Project information

This project aims to implement and explore algorithms that are used in self-driving cars. We implement this on different levels.
1. World model
   - Creates a map and actors within it
2. Routing
   - Computes the intended route based
3. Path planning
   - Within the smaller area surrounding ego, find a feasible path that goes around objects
4. Controller
   - Uses MCP to actually provide the ego with inputs (throttle/brake + steering)

I want these different levels to work together seamlessly, while being able to inspect what is going on for each of them. The goal is learning about these techniques, not necessarily to bring to production 

# Development Guidelines

This document contains critical information about working with this codebase. Follow these guidelines precisely.

## Core Development Rules

1. Package Management
   - ONLY use uv, NEVER pip
   - Installation: `uv add package`
   - Running tools: `uv run tool`
   - Upgrading: `uv add --dev package --upgrade-package package`
   - FORBIDDEN: `uv pip install`, `@latest` syntax

2. Code Quality
   - Type hints required for all code
   - Public APIs must have docstrings
   - Functions must be focused and small
   - Follow existing patterns exactly
   - Line length: 88 chars maximum

3. Testing Requirements
   - Framework: `uv run pytest`
   - Coverage: test edge cases and errors
   - New features require tests
   - Bug fixes require regression tests
   - Only run the integration test when absolutely needed, it takes a long time. If unsure, ask

4. Code Style
    - PEP 8 naming (snake_case for functions/variables)
    - Class names in PascalCase
    - Constants in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
    - Document with docstrings
    - Use f-strings for formatting

## Development Philosophy

- **Simplicity**: Write simple, straightforward code
- **Readability**: Make code easy to understand
- **Performance**: Consider performance without sacrificing readability
- **Maintainability**: Write code that's easy to update
- **Testability**: Ensure code is testable
- **Reusability**: Create reusable components and functions
- **Less Code = Less Debt**: Minimize code footprint

## Coding Best Practices

- **Early Returns**: Use to avoid nested conditions
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear variable/function names (prefix handlers with "handle")
- **Constants Over Functions**: Use constants where possible
- **DRY Code**: Don't repeat yourself
- **Functional Style**: Prefer functional, immutable approaches when not verbose
- **Minimal Changes**: Only modify code related to the task at hand
- **Function Ordering**: Define composing functions before their components
- **TODO Comments**: Mark issues in existing code with "TODO:" prefix
- **Simplicity**: Prioritize simplicity and readability over clever solutions
- **Build Iteratively** Start with minimal functionality and verify it works before adding complexity
- **Run Tests**: Test your code frequently with realistic inputs and validate outputs
- **Build Test Environments**: Create testing environments for components that are difficult to validate directly
- **Functional Code**: Use functional and stateless approaches where they improve clarity
- **Clean logic**: Keep core logic clean and push implementation details to the edges
- **File Organsiation**: Balance file organization with simplicity - use an appropriate number of files for the project scale
